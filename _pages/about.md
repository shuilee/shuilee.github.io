I am currently a student at FPT University, actively engaged in research at the AiTA Lab. Under the guidance of PhD Dang Ngoc Minh Duc, my research primarily focuses on Artificial Intelligence (AI), with specific interests in Medical Image Processing, and Deep Learning. My work involves exploring cutting-edge technologies to advance the capabilities and applications of AI in healthcare and biological data analysis.
